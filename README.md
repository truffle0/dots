# Dots

(This branch is a orphan, and exists to hold convenient install scripts)

Run `install-to-home.sh` to install a *.dots* file in the home directory as a bare repo
As well as to fix a bunch of git settings that make it more convenient to use

Use `source dots-alias` to load an alias, `dots`, of the `git` command.
This alias will set the git dir to the newly-created *.dots* and use your home as the workdir.
